Welcome to our Final Project!

We are predicting PM2.5 Values in Beijing to improve air quality infrastructure

Here are the important features we needed to look at...
1. PM_US Post (Our Target Variable)
2. Year,Month,Day,Hour (Time steps)
3. DEWP, TEMP, HUMI, PRES (Weather statistics)
4. IWS (Cumulated wind Speed)
5. Iprec (Cumulated precipitation)

These are the models
1. Transformer
2. RNN
3. LSTM
4. GRU
5. TCN (Not used in final presentation)
6. CNN (Not used in final presentation)
7. Anomaly Detection

We found that the best preforming model was transformer, however we do understand that this may change if we had more compute power to test more hyperparameters.
